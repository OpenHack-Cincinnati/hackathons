# Hackathons!

We like code. We like working on fun projects. Let's find some fun projects and code
on them! With beer?!

## V1

We're putting together the first hackathon right now. There's a [milestone called V1][V1]
in the [issues][issues] of this repo. I'm associating tasks with that. There's also a
[huboard][board] you can see to get an idea where things are.

We need:

- [ ] A Date
- [ ] A Venue
- [ ] A "Theme"
- [ ] Sponsors
- [ ] Marketing
